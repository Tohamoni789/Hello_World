# Simulation
• Simulation is the imitation of a real-world system in order to obtain data that can be used
to evaluate and improve the system’s performance

# Interarrival Times
• The time difference between arrival of one customer and then the next customer is often referred to as Interarrival time. 
It is a time elapse between the arrival of the object or person and one following it in the queue. This concept is based 
on the values used in queuing theory

# Arrival Times
• The probability density distribution that determines the customer arrivals in the system.

# The Difference Between Arrival Rates and Inter Arrival Times
• The arrival rate is the number of arrivals per unit of time.
• The inter arrival time is the time between each arrival into the system and the next.

*** The arrival rate is calculated from the following equation;
      • arrival rate = 1/inter arrival time

*** The  trick with this equation is that if invert the arrival rate the answer is the inter arrival time  in  simulation =

      •  inter arrival time = 1/arrival rate
